I am a retried School Crossing Guard.  I worked for the NYC Police Department for 28 years as a Guard.  Curreently I am a lady of leisure that likes to learrn.  I want to turn my hobby of soapmaking into a viable business but alas running a business is harder than making the soap.  Evertything is harder than you think but I am chugging along trying to do somethings and farming out the rest.  I want to learrn how to make landing pages that connect to my website and master Google Analtics 4. Lets make this happen.     </main>
